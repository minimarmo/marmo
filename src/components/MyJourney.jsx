        My Journey
      </h2>
      <p className="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-sm sm:text-base text-center leading-relaxed">
        I started my career as a GIS Analyst, but the work became quite routine,
        and the career path wasn’t very clear. That made me start questioning
        myself — I wanted to do something more challenging and with a stronger
        future.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fortunately, my company gave me the opportunity to shift into IT —
        specifically into a role as an IT Developer. Honestly, I had zero coding
        background back then. And to make it even more intense, I had to jump
        straight into a real project from day one.
        <br />
        <br />
        The beginning was tough, but after a while, I told myself:
        <strong>
          "If I finish my tasks faster, I’ll have more time to learn."
        </strong>
        So that’s what I did — for a few months, I focused on learning after
        work, building mini projects, experimenting with new tech, and learning
        from my teammates.
        <br />
        <br />
        As I started to understand how web development worked, it became more
        fun. And now, with AI helping to accelerate learning, it feels like
        having a personal coach by my side.
        <br />
        <br />
        These days, I’m still learning every day. I believe being in tech isn’t
        just about writing great code. It’s also about{" "}
        <strong>
          understanding users, connecting systems, and choosing the right tools
          for the right problems.
        </strong>
        That’s what I strive to develop through every project I take on.
