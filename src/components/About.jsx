        I'm a Developer with hands-on experience in building web applications
        using React, Next, and Node.js. I’ve also worked with data-driven
        systems and GIS solutions, and I’m currently exploring Microsoft Power
        Platform to expand into low-code development that solves real business
        problems. I enjoy learning new technologies and turning complex
        requirements into practical, user-friendly solutions.
